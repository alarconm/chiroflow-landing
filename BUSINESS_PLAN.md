| $40K/year | $7,200/year | 200 | $1.44M |
| $40K/year | $7,200/year | 500 | $3.6M |

**Advantages**: Aligned incentives, easy to sell ("only pay for results")

### Model C: Hybrid (Recommended)

**Base + Performance**

|-----------|--------|-------|
| Base Platform Fee | $199-399/mo | Covers infrastructure, support |
| Success Fee | 10% of savings | Above $20K baseline |
| Implementation | $2,500-5,000 one-time | Setup, training, SOP conversion |

**Example: Kent's Practice**

```
Monthly Base:              $399/mo = $4,788/year
Success Fee (38 hrs × $25): $950/mo = $11,400/year (10% of $114K savings)
Implementation:            $5,000 (one-time)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Year 1 Total:              $21,188
Year 2+ Total:             $16,188/year
Kent's ROI:                $114K savings - $16K cost = $98K net
Our Revenue per Practice:   $16K ARR
```

## 4. Partnership Structures with Kent

### Option A: Founding Partner / Equity Split

**Structure**: True co-founding partnership

| Partner | Contribution | Equity |

| Mike (You) | Tech, AI, automation platform | 50% |
| Kent | Domain expertise, SOPs, first customer, advisor | 30% |
| Reserved | Future employees, advisors | 20% |

**Terms**:
- 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff for both
- Kent's practice becomes "Lab" - free service in exchange for development partnership
- Kent commits 5-10 hrs/week to product development, customer intros
- Kent gets board seat

**Pros**: Maximum alignment, Kent fully invested in success
**Cons**: Large equity grant, complex if relationship changes

### Option B: Advisor + Revenue Share

**Structure**: Kent as paid advisor with revenue share

| Component | Details |

| Advisory Equity | 1-2% over 2 years |
| Revenue Share | 5% of first 50 customers he helps close |
| Free Service | His practice gets free access for 2 years |

**Kent's Compensation**:
- ~$50K equity value at $5M valuation (1%)
- $50K-150K revenue share (if he helps close deals)
- $50K+ savings from free service
- Total potential: $150K-250K over 2-3 years

**Pros**: Lower equity dilution, clear boundaries
**Cons**: Less skin in the game, may not prioritize

### Option C: Licensing + Royalty Deal

**Structure**: License Kent's SOPs, pay ongoing royalty

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| SOP License Fee | $25K upfront for full documentation access |
| Ongoing Royalty | 2-3% of revenue for 5 years |
| Exclusivity | First mover advantage, 12-month head start |

**Pros**: Clean IP transfer, predictable costs
**Cons**: Less involvement, may miss domain insights

### Option D: Joint Venture - Separate Entity

| Capital | Tech platform, AI | Cash ($25-50K) |
| Operations | Development, hosting, sales | Domain expertise, referrals |
| Ownership | 50% | 50% |

**Governance**:

- Annual review of contributions
- Buy-out provisions if one party wants out

**Pros**: Equal partnership, shared risk/reward
**Cons**: Decision-making complexity, need alignment

### Recommended: Option A or B (Hybrid)

**My Recommendation**: Start with **Option B (Advisor + Revenue Share)** with a path to **Option A (Founding Partner)** if things go well.

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6)**: Advisor Agreement
- Kent provides SOPs, becomes first customer
- You build the platform, prove it works
- He gets free service, you get development partner

**Phase 2 (Months 6-12)**: Evaluate Partnership
- If he's highly engaged and valuable → upgrade to co-founder
- If he's passive → keep as advisor with revenue share
- If not working → amicable separation

**Phase 3 (Year 2+)**: Formalize
- Either he's a 20-30% co-founder, or
- He's a 1-2% advisor with ongoing royalties
