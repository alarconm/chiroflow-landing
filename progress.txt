   - Fields: name, reportType, parameters, data, metadata, generatedAt, expiresAt, isStale
   - Proper indexes for performance
   - Multi-tenant support via organizationId

2. Created report-service.ts with core methods:

4. Export to PDF, CSV, Excel formats:
   - Already implemented in export.ts (PDF/Excel are stubs ready for library integration)
   - CSV and JSON fully functional
   - ExportFormat enum: PDF, CSV, EXCEL, JSON

5. Report caching for performance:
   - DEFAULT_CACHE_DURATION: 15 minutes
   - Configurable per-report cache duration
   - forceRefresh option to bypass cache
