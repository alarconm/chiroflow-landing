Epic 40: AI Predictive Analytics Agent

## US-379: Predictive analytics schema - COMPLETED

Date: 2026-01-22

### What was done:
1. Created Prediction model with:
   - predictionType (enum: CHURN, NO_SHOW, REVENUE, DEMAND, OUTCOME, RISK, TREND, CUSTOM)
   - status (enum: PENDING, VALIDATED, INVALIDATED, EXPIRED)
   - targetEntityType and targetEntityId for flexible targeting
   - prediction (Json) for flexible prediction data
   - confidence score (0-1)
   - Model metadata (modelName, modelVersion, features, featureImportance)
   - Actual outcome tracking (actualOutcome, wasAccurate, accuracyScore)
   - Relations to Patient and Organization

2. Created PatientRiskScore model with:
   - riskType (enum: CHURN, NO_SHOW, NON_COMPLIANCE, CHRONIC_PROGRESSION, ADVERSE_EVENT, BILLING_ISSUE, DISSATISFACTION)
   - score (0-100), scoreLevel, confidence
   - factors (Json array of contributing factors)
   - Trend tracking (previousScore, scoreChange, scoreTrend)
   - Alert thresholds and intervention tracking
   - Unique constraint on [patientId, riskType, organizationId]

3. Created DemandForecast model with:
   - forecastDate, appointmentType, providerId, locationId
   - predictedVolume with confidence intervals (predictedRange)
   - Seasonality factors (seasonalFactor, dayOfWeekFactor, holidayImpact)
   - Actual outcome tracking (actualVolume, variance, variancePercent)
   - Staffing recommendations (recommendedStaff, recommendedRooms)

4. Created TrendAnalysis model with:
   - metricType, metricSubtype, entityType, entityId
   - trend direction (enum: INCREASING, DECREASING, STABLE, VOLATILE)
   - Statistical analysis (mean, median, stdDev, min, max)
   - Seasonality pattern detection
   - Forecasting with configurable horizon
   - Anomaly detection (isAnomaly, anomalyScore, anomalyType)
   - Alert triggering and AI recommendations

5. Added supporting enums:
   - PredictionType
   - PredictionStatus
   - RiskType
   - TrendDirection
   - SeasonalityPattern

6. Added relations to Organization and Patient models

7. Successfully ran Prisma db push and generated client

### Files modified:
- app/prisma/schema.prisma (added Epic 40 models and enums)

### Notes:
- ChurnPrediction model already exists from Epic 16 (AI Insights Agent)
- The new Prediction model is more general-purpose for all prediction types
- PatientRiskScore complements ChurnPrediction with additional risk types
- All models include proper indexing for query performance

Story: US-379 - Predictive analytics schema

## US-380: Patient churn prediction - COMPLETED

Date: 2026-01-22

### What was done:
1. Created `app/src/lib/ai-predict/` library with:
   - `types.ts` - Comprehensive type definitions:
     - ChurnPredictionConfig (thresholds, factor weights, analysis params)
     - ChurnRiskFactor (name, weight, rawValue, normalizedScore, impact, contribution)
     - ChurnBehavioralSignal (signal detection with severity levels)
     - VisitPatternChange (period comparison, trend analysis, overdue calculation)
     - EngagementScoreDetails (portal, forms, messages, attendance, payments)
     - ChurnPredictionResult (full prediction with all analysis)
     - RetentionAction (recommended interventions with priority and impact)
     - BatchChurnPredictionResult (bulk processing results)

   - `churn-prediction.ts` - Core prediction engine:
     - `predictChurn()` - Analyze single patient churn risk
     - `batchPredictChurn()` - Batch analyze all patients
     - `saveChurnPrediction()` - Persist to Prediction and PatientRiskScore models
     - `trackChurnPredictionAccuracy()` - Track prediction outcomes
     - `getChurnPredictionAccuracy()` - Get accuracy metrics

2. Implemented 7 risk factor calculations:
   - Visit Recency (days since last visit)
   - Visit Frequency Change (period-over-period comparison)
   - No-Show Rate (no-show percentage)
   - Cancellation Rate (cancellation percentage)
   - Engagement Score (portal, forms, messages, attendance, payments)
   - Outstanding Balance (relative to average visit value)
   - Treatment Completion (adherence to treatment plan)

3. Behavioral signal detection:
   - extended_absence (>60 days)
   - declining_frequency (decreasing trend)
   - high_no_show (>20% rate)
   - high_cancellation (>30% rate)
   - no_upcoming_appointment
   - low_engagement (<30 score)
   - balance_barrier (high outstanding balance)

4. Retention action generation:
   - Action recommendations based on top risk factors
   - Priority levels (immediate, soon, scheduled)
   - Expected impact assessment
   - Automatable vs manual actions

5. Created `app/src/server/routers/aiPredict.ts` router with procedures:
   - `predictChurn` - Predict churn for single patient
   - `batchPredictChurn` - Batch prediction with save option
   - `getAtRiskPatients` - List at-risk patients with pagination
   - `getChurnSummary` - Summary dashboard data
   - `saveChurnPrediction` - Save prediction to database
   - `trackPredictionOutcome` - Record actual outcomes
   - `getPredictionAccuracy` - Get model accuracy metrics
   - `getPatientRiskScore` - Get risk scores for patient
   - `getAllRiskScores` - List all risk scores
   - `recordIntervention` - Record intervention taken

6. Added new audit action types in `app/src/lib/audit.ts`:
   - AI_BATCH_CHURN_PREDICTION
   - AI_CHURN_PREDICTION_SAVED
   - AI_PREDICTION_OUTCOME_TRACKED
   - RISK_SCORE_INTERVENTION

7. Registered aiPredictRouter in `app/src/server/routers/index.ts`

### Files created:
- app/src/lib/ai-predict/types.ts
- app/src/lib/ai-predict/churn-prediction.ts
- app/src/lib/ai-predict/index.ts
- app/src/server/routers/aiPredict.ts

### Files modified:
- app/src/server/routers/index.ts (added aiPredictRouter)
- app/src/lib/audit.ts (added new audit actions)

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- ✅ aiPredict.predictChurn - Identify churn risk
- ✅ Behavioral signals analysis
- ✅ Visit pattern changes
- ✅ Engagement score decline
- ✅ Churn probability scoring
- ✅ Churn risk factors identification
- ✅ Recommended retention actions
- ✅ Track prediction accuracy

### Notes:
- Uses new Epic 40 Prediction and PatientRiskScore models
- Complements existing Epic 16 ChurnPrediction model
- Configurable thresholds and factor weights
- Supports batch processing for all patients
- Includes accuracy tracking for model improvement
