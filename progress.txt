# Ralph Progress Log - Epic 39: AI Clinical Decision Support Agent

## 2026-01-22 - US-371: AI clinical decision schema

### Completed
- Created 5 new Prisma models for clinical decision support:
  - **ClinicalAlert**: Patient safety alerts with type, severity, status, acknowledgment tracking
  - **DiagnosisSuggestion**: AI-suggested diagnoses with confidence scoring and reasoning
  - **TreatmentRecommendation**: Evidence-based treatment recommendations with citations
  - **Contraindication**: Patient-specific treatment contraindications with override capability
  - **ClinicalGuideline**: Evidence-based practice guidelines reference

- Created supporting enums:
  - ClinicalAlertType (RED_FLAG, CONTRAINDICATION, DRUG_INTERACTION, PRECAUTION, GUIDELINE, OUTCOME_ALERT, REFERRAL_NEEDED)
  - ClinicalAlertSeverity (LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, CRITICAL)
  - ClinicalAlertStatus (ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED, RESOLVED, DISMISSED, EXPIRED)
  - EvidenceLevel (HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, VERY_LOW, EXPERT)
  - ContraindicationType (ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE, PRECAUTION)

- Added relations to:
  - Organization model (Epic 39 relations)
  - Patient model (clinicalAlerts, treatmentRecommendations, contraindications)
  - Encounter model (clinicalAlerts, diagnosisSuggestions, treatmentRecommendations)

- Database schema pushed successfully with `prisma db push`
- Prisma client regenerated successfully

### Files Modified
- app/prisma/schema.prisma - Added 5 models, 5 enums, and relations
- prd.json - Marked US-371 as passes: true

### Notes
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in mobile app (missing dependencies) are unrelated to this change
- Pre-existing Next.js route typing issues are unrelated to this change
- Schema compiles and generates correctly

Story: US-371 - AI clinical decision schema

## 2026-01-22 - US-372: Diagnosis suggestion

### Completed
- Created aiClinical.ts tRPC router with comprehensive diagnosis suggestion functionality:

**Main Endpoints:**
1. `aiClinical.suggestDiagnosis` - Get AI-powered diagnosis suggestions
   - Analyzes chief complaint, subjective, and objective findings
   - Uses rule-based matching with common chiropractic ICD-10 codes
   - Integrates Claude Opus 4.5 for AI-enhanced suggestions (when API key present)
   - Returns confidence scores (0-100) for each suggestion
   - Identifies red flags with severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MODERATE, LOW)
   - Creates ClinicalAlert records for detected red flags
   - Stores suggestions in DiagnosisSuggestion table for learning

2. `aiClinical.acceptSuggestion` - Accept a suggestion and add diagnosis to encounter
   - Creates Diagnosis record from suggestion
   - Marks suggestion as accepted for learning
   - Supports setting diagnosis as primary
   - Full audit logging

3. `aiClinical.rejectSuggestion` - Reject a suggestion with optional reason
   - Marks suggestion as rejected with reason for learning
   - Audit trail for improvement

4. `aiClinical.getPendingSuggestions` - Get unprocessed suggestions for encounter

5. `aiClinical.getPatientAlerts` - Get active clinical alerts for patient/encounter

6. `aiClinical.acknowledgeAlert` - Acknowledge a clinical alert

7. `aiClinical.getSuggestionStats` - Analytics for suggestion acceptance rate
   - Total/accepted/rejected counts
   - Acceptance rate calculation
   - Top accepted and rejected codes for learning

**Red Flag Detection:**
- Cauda equina syndrome (CRITICAL)
- Malignancy indicators (HIGH)
- Fracture risk (HIGH)
- Infection signs (HIGH)
- Vascular emergencies (CRITICAL)
- Cervical artery dysfunction (HIGH)

**ICD-10 Code Support:**
- 26 common chiropractic codes built-in
- M54.x (back pain categories)
- M99.0x (segmental/somatic dysfunction)
- M53.x (dorsopathies)
- M47.x (spondylosis)
- M51.x (disc disorders)
- S13.4/S33.5 (sprains)
- And more...

**Learning Capability:**
- Tracks provider acceptance/rejection of suggestions
- Stores rejection reasons for improvement
- getSuggestionStats endpoint for analyzing patterns

### Files Modified
- app/src/server/routers/aiClinical.ts - NEW: Complete AI clinical router (~900 lines)
- app/src/server/routers/index.ts - Added aiClinical router export
- app/src/lib/audit.ts - Added AI Clinical Decision Support audit actions
- prd.json - Marked US-372 as passes: true

### Technical Notes
- Follows existing tRPC patterns from other AI routers
- Uses providerProcedure for clinical endpoints
- Uses protectedProcedure for read-only endpoints
- Full Prisma type safety with proper typing
- Integrates with existing ai-service.ts pattern for Claude API
- Pre-existing errors in mobile app and aiCare.ts are unrelated
