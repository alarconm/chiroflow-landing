Story: US-340 - Revenue leakage detection
COMPLETED: Created aiRevenue.ts router with full leakage detection:
- aiRevenue.detectLeakage procedure with comprehensive leakage analysis
- Unbilled services detection (completed encounters without charges)
- Undercoding identification (low-level E&M codes with complex documentation)
- Missed modifier opportunities (-25 modifier on E&M with CMT)
- Unbilled supplies detection (therapeutic procedures without supply codes)
- Write-off pattern analysis (high adjustment rates by payer)
- Collection rate issues (A/R aging 60-90, 90-120, 120+ days)
- Quantifies leakage by category with priority and annual impact
- Persists findings to RevenueLeakage table
- Added getLeakages, resolveLeakage, getLeakageSummary procedures
- Router added to index.ts as aiRevenue
- TypeScript compilation passes
