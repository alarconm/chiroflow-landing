# Ralph Progress Log - Epic 20: AI Posture & Movement Analysis

## US-208: Posture analysis schema - COMPLETED
Date: 2026-01-22

### Changes Made:
1. Added new enums to schema.prisma:
   - PostureView (ANTERIOR, POSTERIOR, LATERAL_LEFT, LATERAL_RIGHT)
   - DeviationSeverity (MINIMAL, MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, EXTREME)
   - ROMJoint (comprehensive list of all joint movements for cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine and extremities)

2. Created new models:
   - PostureAssessment: Main assessment record linking patient, encounter, images and findings
   - PostureImage: Stores posture photos with metadata, view type, and analysis status
   - PostureLandmark: Body landmarks detected in images (x, y, z coordinates, confidence)
   - PostureDeviation: Documents postural deviations (type, measurement, severity, direction)
   - RangeOfMotion: ROM measurements with degrees, normal values, pain tracking
   - FunctionalMovement: FMS tests with scoring (0-3), asymmetry detection, compensations

3. Updated relations:
   - Organization model: Added postureAssessments, rangeOfMotions, functionalMovements
   - Patient model: Added postureAssessments, rangeOfMotions, functionalMovements
   - Encounter model: Added postureAssessments, rangeOfMotions, functionalMovements

4. Prisma schema validated and pushed to database successfully
5. Prisma client generated successfully
6. TypeScript compilation passes

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] PostureAssessment model with patientId, date, images, findings, measurements
- [x] PostureImage model with imageUrl, view (anterior/posterior/lateral), landmarks
- [x] PostureLandmark model with x, y coordinates for body landmarks
- [x] PostureDeviation model with type, severity, measurement, normal range
- [x] RangeOfMotion model with joint, movement, degrees, normal, restricted
- [x] FunctionalMovement model with test name, score, notes
- [x] Prisma migrations run successfully

Story: US-208 - Posture analysis schema

## US-209: Photo capture and upload - COMPLETED
Date: 2026-01-22

### Changes Made:
1. Created posture image upload API route at `app/src/app/api/posture/upload/route.ts`:
   - Handles multipart form data uploads
   - Validates file types (JPEG, PNG, WebP) and size (20MB max)
   - Auto-orients images using EXIF data via sharp
   - Generates thumbnails (300px width)
   - Creates storage structure: uploads/{orgId}/posture/{patientId}/
   - Auto-creates PostureAssessment if not provided
   - HIPAA-compliant with audit logging

2. Created posture image serve route at `app/src/app/api/posture/images/[...path]/route.ts`:
   - Secure image retrieval with org/patient verification
   - Path traversal prevention
   - Proper cache headers for HIPAA compliance
   - Content-type detection from file extension

3. Created posture tRPC router at `app/src/server/routers/posture.ts`:
   - createAssessment: Create new posture assessment
   - getAssessment: Get assessment with images and deviations
   - listByPatient: List patient's posture assessments
   - deleteImage: Remove image from assessment
   - updateImageNotes: Update notes for an image
   - getViewTypes: Get view type metadata with positioning guides
   - getImagesByView: Get images filtered by view type
   - completeAssessment: Mark assessment complete
   - updateAssessment: Update assessment notes/findings
   - deleteAssessment: Delete assessment (cascade deletes images)
   - getPatientSummary: Summary stats for dashboard

4. Created PostureCapture component at `app/src/components/posture/PostureCapture.tsx`:
   - Camera capture mode with getUserMedia API
   - File upload mode with react-dropzone
   - Support for all four view types (ANTERIOR, POSTERIOR, LATERAL_LEFT, LATERAL_RIGHT)
   - Auto-advance to next view after capture
   - Batch upload capability
   - Image preview with view selection
   - Notes per image
   - Upload progress tracking

5. Created PosturePositioningGuide component at `app/src/components/posture/PosturePositioningGuide.tsx`:
   - SVG body silhouettes for front, back, and side views
   - Grid overlay with landmark alignment lines (eyes, shoulders, hips, knees)
   - Foot positioning marks
   - Instructions panel per view
   - Plumb line reference for lateral views

6. Updated audit.ts with posture-related actions:
   - POSTURE_IMAGE_UPLOAD
   - POSTURE_ASSESSMENT_CREATE
   - POSTURE_ASSESSMENT_UPDATE
   - POSTURE_ASSESSMENT_DELETE
   - POSTURE_ASSESSMENT_COMPLETE

7. Registered posture router in index.ts

8. TypeScript compilation passes

### Files Created:
- app/src/app/api/posture/upload/route.ts
- app/src/app/api/posture/images/[...path]/route.ts
- app/src/server/routers/posture.ts
- app/src/components/posture/PostureCapture.tsx
- app/src/components/posture/PosturePositioningGuide.tsx
- app/src/components/posture/index.ts

### Files Modified:
- app/src/server/routers/index.ts (added posture router)
- app/src/lib/audit.ts (added posture audit actions)

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] posture.uploadImage - Upload posture photo (via API route)
- [x] Camera capture component for in-office photos
- [x] Support anterior, posterior, lateral views
- [x] Standardized positioning guide overlay
- [x] Image cropping and orientation correction (auto-orient via sharp)
- [x] HIPAA-compliant image storage (org/patient scoped, audit logged)
- [x] Batch upload for multiple views
