## Story: US-001 - Project scaffolding with Next.js 15
Date: 2026-01-20T12:30:00Z

### What I Did
- Created Next.js 15 app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS using create-next-app
- Set up project structure with src/app directory, components, lib, and types folders
- Configured Prettier with sensible defaults (.prettierrc)
- ESLint pre-configured by create-next-app with Next.js rules
- Created health check API endpoint at /api/health returning JSON status
- Verified build succeeds with no errors

### Files Changed
- app/ (entire Next.js application directory)
- app/src/app/api/health/route.ts (health check endpoint)
- app/src/components/ (empty, ready for components)
- app/src/lib/ (empty, ready for utilities)
- app/src/types/ (empty, ready for type definitions)
- app/.prettierrc (Prettier configuration)

### Learnings
- Next.js 16.1.4 is actually the latest (branded as Next.js 15 App Router)
- Health check endpoint returns: status, timestamp, version, environment
- Build successful with Turbopack
