## Completed Stories

### US-256: Security schema
- Status: COMPLETE
- Date: 2026-01-22

#### What was implemented:
1. **MFAConfiguration model** - Stores MFA settings for users with TOTP/SMS/Email support, backup codes, verification status
2. **SecurityEvent model** - Comprehensive security event logging with 27+ event types (login, logout, PHI access, permission changes, etc.)
3. **UserSession model** - Enhanced session tracking with device fingerprinting, geolocation, trust scores, MFA verification status
4. **BAADocument model** - Business Associate Agreement tracking for HIPAA compliance with vendor info, risk assessment, expiration dates
5. **EncryptionKey model** - Key lifecycle management for field-level encryption with rotation scheduling
6. **SecuritySetting model** - Organization-level security policies (session timeouts, MFA requirements, password policies, IP restrictions, access hours)

#### Enums added:
- MFAMethod (TOTP, SMS, EMAIL)
- SecurityEventType (27 event types)
- SessionStatus (ACTIVE, EXPIRED, TERMINATED, SUSPICIOUS)
- BAAStatus (DRAFT, PENDING_SIGNATURE, ACTIVE, EXPIRED, TERMINATED)
- EncryptionKeyStatus (ACTIVE, ROTATING, RETIRED, COMPROMISED)

#### Relations added:
- Organization -> securityEvents, userSessions, baaDocuments, encryptionKeys, securitySetting
- User -> mfaConfigurations, securityEvents, userSessions
- Vendor -> baaDocuments

#### Verification:
- Prisma db push successful
- TypeScript compiles without errors

### US-257: Multi-factor authentication
- Status: COMPLETE
- Date: 2026-01-22

#### What was implemented:
1. **TOTP Security Library** (`app/src/lib/security/totp.ts`)
   - TOTP secret generation (RFC 6238 compliant)
   - TOTP code generation and verification with clock drift tolerance
   - Backup codes generation and verification (10 codes, 8-char alphanumeric)
   - OTP generation for SMS/Email (6-digit codes)
   - QR code URI generation for authenticator apps
   - Device fingerprinting for trusted devices
   - Session token generation and hashing

2. **Security Router** (`app/src/server/routers/security.ts`) with procedures:
   - `security.getMFAStatus` - Get current user's MFA configuration
   - `security.setupMFA` - Initialize MFA setup (TOTP, SMS, EMAIL)
   - `security.verifyMFASetup` - Verify initial MFA code during setup
   - `security.verifyMFA` - Verify MFA code at login with backup code support
   - `security.disableMFA` - Disable MFA (with password verification)
   - `security.regenerateBackupCodes` - Generate new backup codes
   - `security.requestMFARecovery` - Start recovery flow for lost device
   - `security.completeMFARecovery` - Complete recovery with token
   - `security.getMFAPolicy` - Get organization MFA policy (admin)
   - `security.updateMFAPolicy` - Update organization MFA policy (admin)
   - `security.listTrustedDevices` - List remembered devices
   - `security.removeTrustedDevice` - Remove single trusted device
   - `security.removeAllTrustedDevices` - Remove all trusted devices
   - `security.checkTrustedDevice` - Check if current device is trusted
   - `security.resendOTP` - Resend SMS/Email verification code
   - `security.checkMFARequired` - Check if user needs MFA

#### Security Features:
- Account lockout after 5 failed MFA attempts (15 min lockout)
- OTP codes expire after 10 minutes
- Backup codes can only be used once each
- Trusted devices valid for 30 days with device fingerprinting
- MFA policy enforcement by role (ADMINS_ONLY) or all users
- Grace period support for MFA requirement
- Security event logging for all MFA operations

#### Verification:
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Router integrated into app router index

### US-258: Field-level encryption
- Status: COMPLETE
- Date: 2026-01-22

#### What was implemented:
1. **Encryption Library** (`app/src/lib/security/encryption.ts`)
   - AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption functions
   - Key generation and management utilities
   - Key identifier generation with purpose tracking
   - Encrypted data format: `enc:v1:keyId:iv:authTag:ciphertext`
   - Key validation and fingerprinting
   - Field-level encryption/decryption helpers
   - SSN-specific encryption with last 4 extraction
   - Batch encryption/decryption operations
   - Key wrapping for secure key storage
   - Re-encryption support for key rotation

2. **Security Router Extensions** (`app/src/server/routers/security.ts`)
   - `security.createEncryptionKey` - Create new encryption key for organization
   - `security.listEncryptionKeys` - List all encryption keys with filtering
   - `security.getEncryptionKey` - Get key for authorized users (role-based access)
   - `security.rotateEncryptionKey` - Rotate key with version tracking
   - `security.retireEncryptionKey` - Retire a key (keeps for decryption)
   - `security.markKeyCompromised` - Mark key as compromised with critical logging
   - `security.encryptValue` - Encrypt a value using specified key
   - `security.decryptValue` - Decrypt a value (auto-detects key from ciphertext)
   - `security.encryptSSN` - Encrypt SSN with last 4 extraction for display
   - `security.getEncryptionKeyAuditLog` - Get access audit log for a key
   - `security.getKeysForRotation` - List keys due for rotation

#### Security Features:
- Envelope encryption: DEKs encrypted with master key (environment variable)
- Role-based key access control
- Key rotation with version tracking
- Comprehensive audit logging for all encryption operations
- PHI access logging for HIPAA compliance
- Support for multiple key purposes (SSN, PHI, Payment, API Keys, Secrets)
- Automatic key rotation scheduling (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly)
- Compromised key tracking

#### Key Purposes Supported:
- PHI_ENCRYPTION - General Protected Health Information
