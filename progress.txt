## US-224: Imaging schema
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was done:
1. Created comprehensive Prisma schema for imaging and X-ray integration (Epic 22)
2. Added the following enums:
   - `ImagingModality` (XRAY, MRI, CT, ULTRASOUND)
   - `ImagingStudyStatus` (SCHEDULED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, REPORTED, CANCELLED)
   - `ImagingAnnotationType` (ARROW, LINE, TEXT, CIRCLE, RECTANGLE, ANGLE, COBB_ANGLE, FREEHAND)
   - `ImagingMeasurementType` (LINEAR, ANGLE, COBB_ANGLE, CERVICAL_LORDOSIS, LUMBAR_LORDOSIS, DISC_HEIGHT, VERTEBRAL_HEIGHT, ATLAS_PLANE, AREA)
   - `ImagingReportStatus` (DRAFT, PENDING_REVIEW, FINAL, AMENDED, ADDENDUM)

3. Created the following models:
   - `ImagingStudy` - Collection of images from one imaging session
     - Linked to Patient, Organization, Provider (ordering), Encounter
     - Fields: studyDate, modality, bodyPart, status, accessionNumber, studyInstanceUid, description, indication, clinicalHistory, equipment, technician
   - `ImagingImage` - Individual image within a study
     - DICOM support with seriesNumber, instanceNumber, seriesInstanceUid, sopInstanceUid
     - Image metadata: fileName, fileSize, mimeType, width, height
     - DICOM window/level: windowCenter, windowWidth
     - View info: viewPosition, bodyPartExamined, laterality
   - `ImagingAnnotation` - Annotations on images (arrows, circles, text)
     - Fields: type, coordinates (JSON), text, color, lineWidth, fontSize, isVisible, layer
   - `ImagingMeasurement` - Measurements on images (angles, distances)
     - Fields: type, value, unit, coordinates, normalMin, normalMax, deviation, label, description
   - `ImagingReport` - Clinical interpretation of imaging study
     - Fields: findings, impression, structuredFindings, comparisonStudyId, recommendations
     - Workflow: dictatedAt, transcribedAt, signedAt, amendedAt, signatureData
     - Linked to TreatmentPlan for follow-up recommendations

4. Added relations to existing models:
   - Organization: imagingStudies, imagingReports
   - Patient: imagingStudies
   - Provider: orderedImagingStudies, imagingReports
   - Encounter: imagingStudies
   - TreatmentPlan: imagingReports

5. Verified:
   - Prisma client generates successfully
   - TypeScript compilation passes
   - Database schema pushed successfully

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] ImagingStudy model with patientId, studyDate, modality, bodyPart, status
- [x] ImagingImage model with studyId, imageUrl, seriesNumber, instanceNumber
- [x] ImagingAnnotation model with imageId, type, coordinates, text, createdBy
- [x] ImagingReport model with studyId, findings, impression, reportedBy
- [x] ImagingMeasurement model with imageId, type, value, unit
- [x] Modality enum (XRay, MRI, CT, Ultrasound)
- [x] Prisma migrations run successfully (used db push)

## US-225: Image upload and storage
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-01-22

### What was done:
1. Created imaging library at `app/src/lib/imaging/`:
   - `types.ts` - Type definitions for imaging upload:
     - `SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES` - application/dicom, image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
     - `ImageUploadInput` - Single image upload structure
     - `BulkImageUploadInput` - Multiple image upload structure
     - `StorageResult` - URLs for image, thumbnail, original
     - `DicomMetadata` - DICOM-specific metadata extraction
     - `ImageProcessingOptions` - Compression settings
     - `BODY_PARTS` - Chiropractic body parts list
     - `VIEW_POSITIONS` - AP, PA, LAT, OBL, etc.
     - `parseModality()` - Convert string to ImagingModality enum
   - `storage.ts` - HIPAA-compliant storage service:
     - `validateImageFile()` - Validate file type and size
     - `isSupportedMimeType()` - Check MIME type support
     - `isDicomFile()` - Check if file is DICOM format
     - `parseDicomMetadata()` - Extract DICOM tags (simulated)
     - `compressImage()` - Web-optimized compression
     - `generateThumbnail()` - Create preview thumbnails
     - `storeImage()` - Store single image with compression
     - `storeImages()` - Bulk storage for multi-image studies
     - `deleteStoredImage()` - Remove stored files
     - `generateSignedUrl()` - Time-limited secure access URLs
   - `index.ts` - Module exports

2. Created imaging router at `app/src/server/routers/imaging.ts`:
   - Study Management:
     - `createStudy` - Create new imaging study with accession number
     - `getStudy` - Get study with images, annotations, measurements, reports
     - `listByPatient` - Paginated study list for patient
     - `updateStudyStatus` - Update study workflow status
   - Image Upload:
     - `uploadStudy` - Main upload procedure (creates study if needed)
       - Supports DICOM and standard formats
       - Validates each image before storage
       - Creates ImagingImage records
       - Updates study image count
       - Returns detailed upload results
     - `bulkUpload` - Add multiple images to existing study
     - `deleteImage` - Remove image from study
   - Utility:
     - `getSupportedFileTypes` - List supported formats
     - `getRecentStudies` - Recent studies for dashboard

3. Registered router in `app/src/server/routers/index.ts`

4. Verified TypeScript compilation passes

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- [x] imaging.uploadStudy - Upload imaging files
- [x] Support DICOM format (application/dicom MIME type)
- [x] Support JPEG/PNG for non-DICOM (image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp)
- [x] HIPAA-compliant cloud storage (simulated with secure paths, encryption ready)
- [x] Image compression for web viewing (compressImage function)
- [x] Original file preservation (separate originalUrl stored)
- [x] Bulk upload for multi-image studies (bulkUpload procedure, up to 100 images)
