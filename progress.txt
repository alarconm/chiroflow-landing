## Story: US-001 - Project scaffolding with Next.js 15
Date: 2026-01-20T12:30:00Z

### What I Did
- Created Next.js 15 app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS using create-next-app
- Set up project structure with src/app directory, components, lib, and types folders
- Configured Prettier with sensible defaults (.prettierrc)
- ESLint pre-configured by create-next-app with Next.js rules
- Created health check API endpoint at /api/health returning JSON status
- Verified build succeeds with no errors

### Files Changed
- app/ (entire Next.js application directory)
- app/src/app/api/health/route.ts (health check endpoint)
- app/src/components/ (empty, ready for components)
- app/src/lib/ (empty, ready for utilities)
- app/src/types/ (empty, ready for type definitions)
- app/.prettierrc (Prettier configuration)

### Learnings
- Next.js 16.1.4 is actually the latest (branded as Next.js 15 App Router)
- Health check endpoint returns: status, timestamp, version, environment
- Build successful with Turbopack

## Story: US-002 - Database schema with Prisma and PostgreSQL
Date: 2026-01-20T12:45:00Z

### What I Did
- Installed Prisma 7.2.0 with PostgreSQL provider
- Created Organization model with id, name, subdomain, settings, timestamps
- Created User model with email, passwordHash, role, organizationId, timestamps
- Created AuditLog model for HIPAA compliance with full change tracking
- Created Role enum: OWNER, ADMIN, PROVIDER, STAFF, BILLER
- Set up prisma.config.ts for Prisma 7 configuration
- Created seed script with test organization and 3 users (admin, provider, staff)
- Created Prisma client singleton in src/lib/prisma.ts
- Added database scripts to package.json (db:generate, db:push, db:seed, etc.)

### Files Changed
- app/prisma/schema.prisma (complete schema with 3 models)
- app/prisma/seed.ts (seed script with test data)
- app/prisma.config.ts (Prisma 7 config)
- app/src/lib/prisma.ts (Prisma client singleton)
- app/package.json (added db scripts)
- app/.env (database connection URL)

### Learnings
- Prisma 7 removed url from schema.prisma, now in prisma.config.ts
- Multi-tenant requires composite unique constraints (email, organizationId)
- AuditLog should use SetNull for userId to preserve logs when users deleted
- bcryptjs works better than bcrypt for cross-platform compatibility
