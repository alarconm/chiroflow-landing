Story: US-085 - Payment processor configuration schema

## 2026-01-21: US-086 - Payment processor abstraction layer

**Status:** COMPLETE

### What was done:

Implemented the complete payment processor abstraction layer with the following components:

#### 1. PaymentProvider Interface (`app/src/lib/payment/provider.ts`)
Already existed with full interface:
- `charge` → `processPayment()` method
- `refund` → `processRefund()` method
- `createCustomer` → `createCustomer()` method
- `savePaymentMethod` → `tokenizeCard()` + `attachPaymentMethod()` methods
- Additional methods: `deletePaymentMethod`, `deleteCustomer`, `getTransactionStatus`, `cancelPayment`, `verifyWebhook`

#### 2. StripeProvider (`app/src/lib/payment/stripe-provider.ts`)
Full production implementation:
- Installed Stripe SDK v20.2.0
- `tokenizeCard()` - Creates payment methods with card details
- `processPayment()` - Creates and confirms PaymentIntents
- `processRefund()` - Creates refunds with reason mapping
- `createCustomer()` - Creates Stripe customers
- `attachPaymentMethod()` - Attaches payment methods to customers
- `verifyWebhook()` - Verifies webhook signatures and parses events
- Proper error handling with Stripe error codes and decline codes
- Card brand and card type mapping (credit/debit detection)

#### 3. MockPaymentProvider (`app/src/lib/payment/mock-provider.ts`)
Already existed with full implementation:
- Simulates Stripe-like behavior for development
- Test card numbers for various scenarios (success, declines, HSA/FSA)
- In-memory storage for customers, payment methods, transactions
- Full webhook simulation support

#### 4. Environment-based Provider Selection (`app/src/lib/payment/index.ts`)
Already existed with:
- `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` env var support ('mock' | 'stripe')
- `getPaymentProvider()` singleton factory function
- Automatic initialization with config from env vars
- `resetPaymentProvider()` for testing

#### 5. Secure Credential Handling (`app/src/lib/payment/crypto.ts`)
New file created:
- AES-256-GCM encryption for API keys
- `encryptPaymentCredential()` / `decryptPaymentCredential()` functions
- `encryptProcessorCredentials()` / `decryptProcessorCredentials()` for batch operations
- `validateStripeKeyFormat()` for key validation
- `maskCredential()` for safe display
- Version field for future-proof migrations

### Files Modified/Created:
- `app/src/lib/payment/stripe-provider.ts` - Full implementation
- `app/src/lib/payment/crypto.ts` - NEW: Credential encryption utilities
- `app/src/lib/payment/index.ts` - Added crypto exports
- `app/package.json` - Added stripe v20.2.0 dependency

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
✅ PaymentProvider interface with charge, refund, createCustomer, savePaymentMethod
✅ StripeProvider implementing the interface
✅ MockPaymentProvider for development and testing
✅ Environment-based provider selection
✅ Secure credential handling with encryption

### Validation:
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- All exports available from `@/lib/payment`

## 2026-01-21: US-087 - Card payment processing

**Status:** COMPLETE

### What was done:

Verified and enhanced the card payment processing system. The core functionality already existed in `payment-processing.ts` router; added automatic email receipt functionality.

#### 1. processPayment Procedure (Existing - `payment-processing.ts:281`)
Already implemented with full functionality:
- Accepts `patientId`, `paymentMethodId`, `amount`, `description`
- Optional `applyTo` for specific charge allocation
- Optional `autoAllocate` for oldest-first charge allocation
- `idempotencyKey` support for duplicate prevention

#### 2. Secure Card Entry (Existing)
- Cards are tokenized via Stripe Elements or similar on client-side
- Only payment tokens (not raw card numbers) are stored
- `StoredPaymentMethod` model holds tokenized card references
- `PaymentForm.tsx` component uses stored payment methods only

#### 3. Handle Declined Cards (Existing)
- Payment provider returns detailed error info: `errorCode`, `errorMessage`, `declineCode`
- Transaction record created with failure details
- TRPCError thrown with user-friendly message
- Audit log captures failure details

#### 4. Create Ledger Entry (Existing)
- On success, creates `Payment` record
- Optionally creates `PaymentAllocation` records linking to charges
- Updates charge balances and statuses
- Transaction linked to Payment for full audit trail

#### 5. Email Receipt to Patient (NEW)
Added automatic email receipt functionality:
- Fetches patient contact info with `allowEmail` preference
- Sends receipt after successful payment (non-blocking)
- Beautiful HTML email with:
  - Payment confirmation header
  - Amount, date, payment method
  - Transaction reference number
  - Allocation details
  - Credit balance if applicable
  - Organization branding
- Plain text fallback for email clients

### Files Modified:
- `app/src/server/routers/payment-processing.ts` - Added email receipt functionality
  - Line 25: Added imports for `getCardBrandDisplayName`, `maskCardNumber`, `notificationService`
  - Lines 308-324: Enhanced patient query to include contacts
  - Lines 325-328: Added organization query for branding
  - Lines 510-606: Added email receipt sending logic

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
✅ payment.processCard - Charge a card for patient balance (as `processPayment`)
✅ Secure card entry using Stripe Elements or equivalent
✅ Store payment method for future use (with patient consent)
✅ Handle declined cards gracefully with clear error messages
✅ Create ledger entry and receipt on successful payment
✅ Email receipt to patient automatically

### Validation:
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Email sending is fire-and-forget (doesn't block payment response)
- Respects patient email preferences (`allowEmail` flag)

## 2026-01-21: US-088 - Refund processing

**Status:** COMPLETE

### What was done:

Enhanced the existing `processRefund` procedure in `payment-processing.ts` to fully implement all acceptance criteria for US-088.

#### 1. payment.processRefund - Refund full or partial amount (Enhanced)
Already existed, but enhanced with:
- Better transaction fetching including payment allocations
- Proportional refund calculation for partial refunds
- Support for both full and partial refunds with correct accounting

#### 2. Require reason for refund (Already existed)
- `reason: z.string().min(1, 'Refund reason is required')` validation
- Optional `reasonCategory` for categorizing refunds

#### 3. Create reversing ledger entry (NEW)
For each payment allocation:
- Calculates proportional amount to reverse based on refund ratio
- Updates charge's `payments` field (reduces by refund amount)
- Recalculates and updates charge's `balance` field
- Reverts charge status from PAID to BILLED if balance becomes positive

For the Payment record:
- Full refund: Voids the entire payment with reason
- Partial refund: Adjusts payment amount and unapplied amount, adds note

#### 4. Update patient balance (NEW)
- Reverses payment allocations proportionally
- Charge balances are recalculated: balance = fee * units - payments - adjustments
- Charges that were PAID get reverted to BILLED status when balance > 0

#### 5. Email refund confirmation to patient (NEW)
Sends automatic email notification with:
- Refund amount and reference number
- Original transaction reference
- Payment method information
- 5-10 business day processing notice
- Beautiful HTML template with refund icon
- Plain text fallback
- Respects patient email preferences (`allowEmail` flag)
- Fire-and-forget (non-blocking)

#### 6. Audit trail for all refunds (Enhanced)
Now includes comprehensive audit logging:
- Original transaction and payment IDs
- Refund amount and type (full/partial)
- Reason and reason category
- Processor refund ID
- Complete list of reversed allocations with charge IDs and CPT codes
- Failed refund attempts are also logged

### Files Modified:
- `app/src/server/routers/payment-processing.ts`
  - Lines 651-1003: Complete rewrite of `processRefund` procedure
  - Added proper payment allocation reversal logic
  - Added proportional refund calculation
  - Added email notification with HTML template
  - Enhanced audit logging

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
✅ payment.processRefund - Refund full or partial amount
✅ Require reason for refund
✅ Create reversing ledger entry
✅ Update patient balance
✅ Email refund confirmation to patient
✅ Audit trail for all refunds

### Validation:
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Email sending is fire-and-forget (doesn't block refund response)
- Respects patient email preferences
